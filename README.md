# AutoPilot for Space Engineers

## Overview

Welcome to the AutoPilot project, a sophisticated script for Space Engineers developed by Elias Traunbauer. This script employs PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controllers to enable precise and automated piloting of spacecraft, handling various navigational aspects such as position and orientation.

## Features

- **PID Control**: Utilizes PID controllers for stable and responsive auto piloting.
- **3D Navigation Management**: Manages X, Y, Z axes for spatial positioning.
- **Orientation Control**: Handles Yaw, Pitch, and Roll for precise directional orientation.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate smoothly with the Space Engineers game environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Space Engineers game installed.
- Basic understanding of scripting within Space Engineers.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Elias-Traunbauer/AutoPilot.git
   ```
2. Follow the in-game guide to import the AutoPilot script into your Space Engineers game.

### Usage

- The script can be used to automatically pilot spacecraft, managing all aspects of navigation and orientation. Detailed usage instructions and configurations will be available in the script documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the AutoPilot script are welcome. This can include feature improvements, bug fixes, or documentation enhancements.
